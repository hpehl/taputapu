Taputapu ([Maori for "utensil"](http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?dictionaryKeywords=taputapu)) is a small library which originated as a collection reservoir for all the nifty little classes of my various GWT projects. 

Currently Taputapu ships with the following modules:
  * Action: Contains classes to execute several asynchronous actions in an ordered sequence
  * Timer: Contains classes to manage several timer instances
  * UI: Contains various UI helper classes (primarily a collection of static methods)
